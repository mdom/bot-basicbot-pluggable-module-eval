NAME
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Eval - Evaluate perl code in your
    channel

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    This module evaluate any perl code and returns the output to the
    questioner. The code is run in a forked process, so the bot is still
    active while running the code. This module uses Safe to sandbox the
    running code, so please refer to its documentation for any security
    implications.

    This module does not print the return code of the executed code back to
    the channel, so you have to handle this yourself.

        !load Eval
        perl eval print "foo"
        perl eval foreach (qw(foo bar)) { print }
